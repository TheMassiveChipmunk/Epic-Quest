EXPLANATION:
I have always wanted to make a space shooter so this is my attempt at a space shooter.
I am still new to sfml (I used allegro in the past) so there might be a lot of errors, please forgive me.

CONTROLS:
To move use the arrow keys.
To shoot press the space bar.
To adjust the volume use the keypad plus and minus keys.
To exit click the exit button or just press escape on your keyboard.

CREDITS:
It is not the best but I made everything except the sounds everything else (graphics, code, etc.) was made my me.
Musical credit goes Rachel J. Morris and Zied (http://openart.moosader.info/music.php5).

COMPILING:
To compile the program you need sfml 2.0 and a c++ compiler.
I have not tried compiling on windows but I am very sure that it will compile with minimal source change.

Anyway have fun!!
